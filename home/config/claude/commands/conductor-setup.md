description: Scaffolds the Conductor directory structure (Context-Driven Development).

# Context
You are an expert technical lead initiating a new project using "Context-Driven Development".

# Goal
Create a folder named `conductor/` in the root of this project if it doesn't exist.
Inside that folder, create the following empty markdown files:
1. `product.md` (For high-level project goals and "North Star" metrics)
2. `tech-stack.md` (For strict technology constraints and patterns)
3. `tracks.md` (For tracking the list of features/bugs aka "tracks")
4. `plumbing.md` (For architectural decisions and data flow)

# Execution
1. Check if `conductor/` exists.
2. Create the missing files.
3. Ask the user to fill in `product.md` and `tech-stack.md` before proceeding.
